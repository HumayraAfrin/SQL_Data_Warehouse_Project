## 🚀 Project Requirements

### **Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**


**Objective**

Develop a scalable data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data and support informed decision-making.

**Specifications**

- **Data Sources:** The project integrates data from two primary source systems—ERP and CRM—provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** All ingested data undergoes cleansing and validation to resolve inconsistencies and ensure accuracy prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Data from both sources is consolidated into a unified, query-optimized model designed to support analytical workloads.
- **Scope:** The warehouse focuses exclusively on the most recent dataset. Historical data retention or historization is not required.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of the data model is provided to facilitate understanding and usage by both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
